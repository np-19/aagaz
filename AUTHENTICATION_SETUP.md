# Clerk Authentication Setup

This document outlines the Clerk authentication implementation for the Aagaz React application.

## Setup Complete ✅

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `@clerk/clerk-react` - Official Clerk React SDK

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` file with `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- **Important**: You need to add your actual Clerk publishable key to the `.env` file

### 3. Provider Setup
- Wrapped the app with `ClerkProvider` in `main.jsx`
- Added error handling for missing publishable key

### 4. Authentication Components
- **SignIn Page** (`/sign-in`) - Custom styled sign-in component
- **SignUp Page** (`/sign-up`) - Custom styled sign-up component
- **ProtectedRoute** - HOC to protect authenticated routes

### 5. Route Protection
- All dashboard routes now require authentication
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in`
- After authentication, users are redirected to `/dashboard`

### 6. UI Updates
- **Navbar**: Shows `UserButton` with profile management for authenticated users
- **Landing Page**: Dynamic buttons based on authentication status
  - Unauthenticated: "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons
  - Authenticated: "Dashboard" button

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Clerk Keys
1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create an account
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your publishable key from the dashboard
4. Replace `your_clerk_publishable_key_here` in `.env` with your actual key

### 2. Configure Clerk Dashboard
